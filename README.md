# Vivid Landing Page Template (Simple)

This is a ready to use template for any landing page you need, built with React, NextJS, and Tailwind CSS.

Modelled after the [Vivid landing page](https://vivid.lol).

> NOTE: This version of our landing page template is simplified to be less modular than our [standard template](https://github.com/vivid-labs/vivid-landing-template). Although this has some downsides for code quality, it makes this project more approachable for those unfamiliar with front end.
